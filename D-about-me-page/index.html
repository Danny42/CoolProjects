                My name is <strong>Daniel van den Berg</strong>. I am a Graphic and Web designer. I studied graphic design and got intoroduced to the basics of web development. Everything else I know about development was self-taught and from workplace experience and includes HTML, CSS and Javascript, Wordpress and more. I love digital art and create my own during spare time with drawings, Photoshop and Blender that I post on Behance. I am outgoing, creative and have a keen eye for the fine details.

  <h3>MY WORK</h3>
  <p>I had the opporunity to work as a web desginer and developer for 4 years at eNew Media. This job has given me the exposure to all kinds of fields and tasks required to produce for an advertising agency. Our main focus lied in the IT industry, but I've also had the opportunity to work for clients listed in the JSE, Astralfoods and Sabvest and more. Mobile is the era of the future, and everything I built, had to be responsive for mobile users. Below is a short overview of the projects and websites I created adn colaborated with during my time there. </p>

    <h3>Enterprise Outsourcing</h3>
  <p>This company is seen as the umbrealla company for all of the different IT divisions, and was seen as our main priority with all the marketing and advertising that took place. We catered for all of our divisions in this website and was always our biggest challenge. This website has been redesigned and updated since, and will not reflect the work presented anymore. </p>
  
   <h3>Secured Enterprise </h3>
  <p>The sucurity devisionwas defenitly one of the more interesting and challenging areas we had to market and advertise. With all the intrigate services and benefits, along with all the clich√® steriotypes people tend to think of in this field of work. This website was definetly one of my favourite creations, with scrolling interactive banners and interactive tabs, cutting the huge loads of information into short snippets that does not overwhelm the viewer. This website has been redesigned and updated since, and will not reflect the work presented anymore.  </p>
  
   <h3>HR ARTIS </h3>
  <p>HR artis is a HR and workforce managemnent application for both mobile and desktop, and was also the HR system I used as an employee internally. As an agency we recently moved over to a CMS platform "Wordpress", where this site has been created. This website is also one of my most recnt projects I had the opportunity to work on individually. <a href="https://www.hrartis.com/">VIEW THE WEBSITE</a> </p>
  
     <h3>FinanceApps</h3>
  <p>Financeapps is a procurement management application created by our application devs. (Dont mistake the name for a financial bookkkeeping application)  This application is iplemented as a procurement management and product and finance wastage solution. The majority of the target market was fast food and local food producing businesses that can use the app to manage their stock and finances more effectively. This website runs from a CMS platform "Wordpress". This website is also one of my most recnt projects I had the opportunity to work on individually. <a href="https://www.financeapps.com/za/">VIEW THE WEBSITE</a>  </p>
  
   <h3>ENew Media</h3>
  <p>eNew Media, The digital advetising agency I was employed at and had the opportunity to collaborate and build the website back when I first joined the team. As a team we were always occupied with all of our other companies and clients, and was unable to give the website the care adn love it deserved, with the knowledge I know now. The website is a bit dated, but it still looks good and met our requirements for the overall brand and mobilility. <a href="https://www.enewmedia.com/za/index.html">VIEW THE WEBSITE</a>   </p>
  
   <h3>Thoughtware</h3>
  <p>The application creators of HR artis, Finacneapps and more is known as Thoughtware. While the dev teams responibilities included the creation of these appliactions, ours was to market them and their products, as individual entities. This website is minimalistic, yet it provides the message we intended for it. This website was one of the many that allowed me to strenghten my knowledge with video content on webpages across multiple devices and sizes. Safari browsers had a unique setting that blocks video content on websites and that also gave me the opportunity to learn more about safari browser settings and functionality.<a href="https://www.thoughtware.co.za/index.html">VIEW THE WEBSITE</a>   </p>
  
   <h3>Astralfoods</h3>
  <p>Astralfoods was one of most important clients and the relationship with them has always been very strong. Their website was redesigned on 2020 and they are still requesting regular updates and documents to be uploaded whenever they release new information on the JSE. I would ocasionally upload new things every month, and when financial year end has passed, I was tasked to upload all of their updates relating this as well. I would personally remain in contact with them when updates were needed, and I was tasked with the responsibility of making these updates and keeping our clients happy. Major updates would occur yearly, and mothly updates included SENS and general meeting.    <a href="https://www.astralfoods.com/news.html">VIEW THE WEBSITE</a>   </p>
  
     <h3>Sabvest and Sabvest Capital</h3>
  <p>Sabvest and Sabvest Capital was nother one of most important clients. Their website was redesigned updated by myself and they registerd Sabvest Capital, a new website I had to opportunity to design myself. The website required regular updates and documents to be uploaded whenever they release new information on the JSE. I would ocasionally upload new things every month, and when financial year end has passed, I was tasked to upload all of their updates relating this as well. I would personally remain in contact with them when updates were needed, and I was tasked with the responsibility of making these updates and keeping our clients happy. Major updates would occur yearly, and mothly updates included SENS and general meeting.

   <h3>VH Law</h3>
  <p>This website is one of my most recent creations during my time at eNew Media. VH Law is a lawfirm in Sandton. You would think that the website should be very formal and corpororate, but they sugguested otherwise. This website allowed me to test my capabilities with almost no creative boundaries. This website has animations, smooth scrolls, interactive elements like particles and more. The challenge with this website was that It had to be done in Wordpress. Javascript in wordpress? Yes! it sounds crazy but not impossible! This website has unfortunately not made it to the live environment, yet.
    </p>
  
  
  <h3>Other Personal Things</h3>
  <p>My interests and passion will always remain strong for digital arts and creations. I've been drawing and doodling from a young age and those creative interests have only grown over the years, and across a combination of other platforms and tools. I also enjoy manipulating or creating compositions in programs like Photoshop and Illustrator. I've also recently been taking my creatives over to a 3D environment using Blender for 3d creations and animations. Here are some of my projects ive done in my spare time.<br>
    
    MORE COMING SOON!
